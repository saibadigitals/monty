This ALX School project is a custom ByteCode interpreter, coded in C. Compilation: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty Usage: ./monty byte_file.m

The program reads from the file "byte_file.m" that contains one instruction per line. It then calls the right function to modify a stack according to the instruction. It prints custom error messages if the instruction is wrong.
